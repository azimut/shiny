*famous last words*

Experiments with music composition in lisp with some ocassional OpenGL interaction with CEPL.

## Demo(s)
* compositions/[molecularmusic.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubgOlfUOztU) - music pattern with simple 3d graphics
* compositions/[snow_world.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUjnlnctdDI) - game sprite based animation
* compositions/[notalent.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unc9Hx3KdGU) - 2d sdf functions based on the pixelshader cards
* compositions/[mondaycv.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltb_nNCyqoI) - opencv video sequencing
* compositions/[gme.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DasB0di7iAw) - opencv multi video sequencing, with live nsf (nintento sound format) sequencing
* compositions/[all-i-wanted.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwanBI9jTt8) - opencv multi video sequencing, with incudine synths and samples sliced from Furi
* compositions/[empty.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bybN395ssVQ) - csound through cffi, 3d scene and some fluidsynth

## Goals
I found both libraries really interesting and the only sane way to do livecoding.

My goal is learn enough of both topics by taking popular and forgotten topics of both areas and mixing them in interesting ways.

## Installation

### Libraries not on main Quicklisp
You don't need to have all these, but some .asd files or examples will require them.
