# somecepl

Personal space to keep my experiments with music composition in lisp with some ocassional interaction with opengl (CEPL).

## Demo(s)
* compositions/[molecularmusic.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubgOlfUOztU) - music pattern with simple 3d graphics
* compositions/[snow_world.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUjnlnctdDI) - game sprite based animation
* compositions/[notalent.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unc9Hx3KdGU) - 2d sdf functions based on the pixelshader cards
* compositions/[mondaycv.lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ltb_nNCyqoI) - opencv video sequencing

## Goals
I found both libraries really interesting and the only sane way to learn these topics.

So far I translated some of the [extempore](https://github.com/digego/extempore) functionality related to music composition (see musicutils.lisp) so It can be used almost for the same.

My goal is learn enough of both topics by taking popular and forgotten topics of both areas and mixing them in interesting ways.
